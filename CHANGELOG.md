## LSP4J Change Log

### v0.10.0 (Date TBD)

Breaking API changes:
 * In LSP Protocol `TextDocumentSyncOptions.save` was previously of type
   `SaveOptions`. To match a clarification in LSP spec it is now
   `Either<Boolean, SaveOptions>`. This change in the LSP spec was applied
   to the 3.15 version of the LSP spec. See [LSP issue #989](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/989).



### v0.9.0 (Feb. 2020)

 * Implemented DAP version 1.36.0
 * Implemented DAP version 1.37.0 (except CancelRequest)
 * Implemented LSP version 3.15.0 (except Progress)
 * Improved compatibility with prior versions of `vscode-languageclient` (https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j/issues/407)

Fixed issues: https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j/milestone/15?closed=1

Breaking API changes:
 * In DebugProtocol fields which were `@NonNull Long` are now `int` as they
   are required. This brings the DAP implementation in LSP4J in line with
   the LSP implementation under the same conditions.

 * In DebugProtocol fields which were `@NonNull Boolean` are now `boolean`
   as they are required. This brings the DAP implementation in LSP4J in
   line with the LSP implementation under the same conditions.

 * In DebugProtocol fields which used to be defined as `Long` are now `Integer`.
   This is due to changes in DAP 1.36 and clarification sought from
   https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/90

 * The DebugProtocol's `EvaluateResponse`'s field `memoryReference` was previously incorrectly
   declared as `Long`, it is now correctly declared as `String`

 * `CodeActionKindCapabilities.valueSet` marked with `@NonNull`

 * Parameters for the following requests have been changed from `TextDocumentPositionParams`
     * `textDocument/signatureHelp` changed to `SignatureHelpParams`
     * `textDocument/hover` changed to `HoverParams`
     * `textDocument/declaration` changed to `DeclarationParams`
     * `textDocument/definition` changed to `DefinitionParams`
     * `textDocument/typeDefinition` changed to `TypeDefinitionParams`
     * `textDocument/implementation` changed to `ImplementationParams`
     * `textDocument/documentHighlight` changed to `DocumentHighlightParams`
     * `textDocument/prepareRename` changed to `PrepareRenameParams`

  * The LSP's Protocol `Diagnostic` field `code` was previouslyt incorrectly declared as `String`,
    it is now correctly declared as `Either<String, Number>`
